      "The STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. I'm not alone in my struggle to recall what each letter stands for, and recalling this acronym in the heat of an interview is twice as difficult. Going further, even the different letters require a memorized definition; What really sets apart the \"Situation\" from the \"Task\"? In describing the task, there requires some explanation of the \"why\", both of which are truly intertwined in practice. In seperating both of these concepts so decidedly, the natural flow of explanation is disrupted, and answers dwindle down to little more than checking off the next of several bullet points.",
      "In simplifying the natural rhythm of answering traditional STAR questions, I found myself coming back to my own alternative method of answering, with a much easier to remember acronym while interviewing. The new method I employ is the \"PSI\" approach: Problem, Solution, Impact. The problem in this case is much easier to define, simply, \"What needed a solution and how did the need for that solution arise?\". The solution contains the steps that were necessary to solve the problem, a combination of both the task and action from the STAR method. The impact remains the same as the result from the STAR method, however, the specific terminology encouraged me to speak much more broadly on how my actions affected those around me. I hope that this information proves useful to others, and that I might one day see it in use by another interviewee while on the other side of the interviewing table.",
